## Links to JQuery Plugins
SmartMenu
http://vadikom.github.io/smartmenus/src/demo/

- This plugin was used on the entire site for the Nav. I loved how simple it was to install and how clean the mobile version looks. Had a little trouble trying to center the links. 

Fotorama 
http://fotorama.io/

- This plugin was used on the 'Menu' page as the image carousel. 

Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons
http://kurtnoble.com/labs/rrssb/

- This plugin was used on the 'Menu' page as well to create the social sharing buttons. Also used to make the buttons responsive. I opted to take out the social media icons on the footer on the menu page to encourage users to share the menu page with their own social networks.

Social Media Icons

- I loved these simply social media icons and used them on the first two pages of this site. 

URL Decoder/Encoder

- This was used for the last plugin to help with the messages that were meant to be posted. 

## Comments 

The social media plugins I wanted to put in were for Instagram, but the six I tried didn't work. Even after I obtained my Instagram developer client ID and access token, the images stayed completely blank. I opted to use an embed code provided by Instagram for the 'Ongoing Promotions' requirement of the project.
